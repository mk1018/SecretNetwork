# Secret Contract Devs

Developers can write Secret Contracts for CosmWasm running inside secure enclaves with encryption capabilities, enabling computation over private data in contracts running on the live Secret Network. 

Currently, we have a [contract development guide for developers](../archive/contract-dev-guide.md) that demonstrates how to get the Secret Network up and running on a local deployment using Docker, as well as how to write simple contracts in Rust using CosmWasm.
