# Project Structure

The source directory (`src/`) has these files:
```
contract.rs  lib.rs  msg.rs  state.rs
```

The developer modifies `contract.rs` for contract logic, contract entry points are `init`, `handle` and `query` functions.

`init` in the Counter contract initializes the storage, specifically the current count and the signer/owner of the instance being initialized.

We also define `handle`, a generic handler for all functions writing to storage, the counter can be incremented and reset. These functions are provided the storage and the environment, the latter's used by the `reset` function to compare the signer with the contract owner.

Finally we have `query` for all functions reading state, we only have `query_count`, returning the counter state.

The rest of the contract file is unit tests so you can confidently change the contract logic.

The `state.rs` file defines the State struct, used for storing the contract data, the only information persisted between multiple contract calls.

The `msg.rs` file is where the InitMsg parameters are specified (like a constructor), the types of Query (GetCount) and Handle[r] (Increment) messages, and any custom structs for each query response.

```rs
use schemars::JsonSchema;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct InitMsg {
    pub count: i32,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "lowercase")]
pub enum HandleMsg {
    Increment {},
    Reset { count: i32 },
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "lowercase")]
pub enum QueryMsg {
    // GetCount returns the current count as a json-encoded number
    GetCount {},
}

// We define a custom struct for each query response
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct CountResponse {
    pub count: i32,
}

```
