## Resources
Smart Contracts on the Secret Network use cosmwasm. Therefore, for troubleshooting and additional context, cosmwasm documentation may be very useful. Here are some of the links we relied on in putting together this guide:

- [cosmwasm repo](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm)
- [cosmwasm starter pack - project template](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-template)
- [Setting up a local "testnet"](https://www.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/using-the-sdk)
- [cosmwasm docs](https://www.cosmwasm.com/docs/intro/overview)

# What's next?

- [CosmWasm JS](cosmwasm-js.md)
